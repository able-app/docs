## Properties

### Type

All of the options available for use in the App Bar are collected here.

* **Icon** - The default for most controls in the app bar, the display of an icon that serves as a metaphor for an activity.
* **Text** - Used interchanabily with icons to spell out the action being preformed when the control is interacted with.
* **Button** - To provide a little more visibility to th action we can use buttons in the app bar with text and/or icons.
* **Avatar** - When we'd like to use an avatar instead of an icon. This is commonly used for a users profile or settings area navigation.
* **Logo** - This can be a logo for branding purposes or an illustration.
* **Wordmark** - A little larger space for a graphic or illustration to exist.
* **Title** - Used to provide content to the current screen or to inform of an action that is being taken on the screens contents.
* **Toggle** - Used as a filter or as an alternative to tabs.
* **Input** - Most often used as a search field but it could take on other text input concepts.
* **Tab Bar** - A horizontally scrollable tab bar for navigating to the primary sections of the application.
* **NavToggle** - An expandable grouping or single toggle button that has the primary purpose of navigating back in the history stack, with a secondary action to expand-and-reveal additional tools available in the newly revealed toggle buttons.
