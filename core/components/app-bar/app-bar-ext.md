## Properties

### Type

* **Input** - Normally used as a search field the input can be used to filter or search the contents being displayed.
* **Tab Bar** - Either a scrollable or fixed tabs that act to section off the content being displayed or as tools to take action.
* **Toggle Bar** - Scrollable or fixed a toggle bar can be used to section off content or as a tool bar.
* **Chip Bar** - Typically used with filtering chips can be turned on/off to narrow the results being displayed. Chips can act as a simple toggle on/off or offer more complex filtering by opening a sheet, dialog box or screen to calibrate the filter.
* **Avatar Bar** - A helpful side-scrolling bar of avatars that can be used when the intent is to select a person from a defined list.
* **Graphic Bar** - Used in situations when a picture is worth a thousand words. A good example of this is with a photo filters to visually display how the selected image would appear with the each filter type.
* **Card Bar** - Similar in use to the Image, this option gives a little more elevation to the image in a card format.
* **AdaptIcon Bar** - Often used in situations where you are narrowing a selection by a type, for example with a search on a map for gas stations where different "types" of establishments can be in each of the adaptIcons.
* **Info** - When the primary app bar doesn't provide an area for general screen information or screen level controls we can apply the info extension.

## Functionality
