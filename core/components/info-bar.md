# Info Bar

Element: A grouping for design convenience for display in the bar component. The bar component can have different background surfaces (colors) so we don't include a surface here.

## Properties

### Layout

The general appearance of the element within the space.

**ListName + Actions:** Used when we need to provide content to the list, in a title for the list, and controls for the scrollview content outside of the base app bar.

**Message:** Used when we want to provide a message to the user directly above or below the App Bar, in the Extension area. For example when either the app or OS provides a message to the user, like an SMS'd access code.
