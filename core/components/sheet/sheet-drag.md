## Use

The entire surface of the Sheet Drag is a hit area to allow a tap/click and drag to change the height of the sheet to its other breakpoint (anchored) heights, as determined by the contents of the sheet. On a tap+drag the sheet gradually grows/shrinks and once released will snap to the closest breakpoint (anchor). For an example of in app use please see the Google/Apple Maps search sheet.
