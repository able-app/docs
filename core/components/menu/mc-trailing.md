## Properties

* **Icon** - Primarily used to provide a second level of context to the menu option. An example of this would be a list, with its accessibility options to others (public, private).
* **Choice** - Used to give the user a visual for the menu options that are currently selected. This choice option can function as a singular choice or multi-choice.
* **Chevron** - When there's the need for hierarchical menu system we can use the chevron to indicate another level of choices in the menu structure.
