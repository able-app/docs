# Tab Bar

Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy. Each tab should contain content that is distinct from other tabs in a set.

* Child: [Tab](../overview/tab/)

## Properties

### Type

* **Icon:** Tab Bar with Icons on each Tab
* **Text:** Word(s) used on each Tab
* **Icon Left:** An Icon to the left of word(s) on the Tab
* **Icon Top:** An Icon above word(s) on the Tab

### Side-Scroll

* **Off** (Fixed) - The width of the tabs are fixed (depending on the number of tabs) and there is NO horizontal scrolling of the tabs.
* **On** (Scroll) - The width of a tab is set based on its content and tabs can scroll off the side of the screen horizontally.

### Surface

* Base: This uses the default Mode (Light) for the tab bar. If the devices mode were to be changed in the settings or by the device settings this would also change to reflect that setting.
* Dark: This locks the background color to a darker tint.  This is useful for areas of the app like the camera where we want to keep the tab bar in a darker mode no matter the settings of the app or device.
