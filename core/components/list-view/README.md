### Header

A header (aka SecHead) can exist at the top of a ListView and be used to separate list content into different collections under that header. That Section Header has a title and can have additional actionable icons associated with the section to take action on the collection.

## Functionality

The ListItems dynamically changes its width to fill the space based on the width of a portrait format screen. For the most part, the heights of ListItems is a fixed height and are stacked one on top of another down the screen in a single column for small form factor (phone) devices in portrait and landscape mode.
