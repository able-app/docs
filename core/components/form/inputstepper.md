## Properties

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the form control. This label can be positioned to the left, right, above (top), below (bottom).

### Helper Text

To provide additional context for the component a sentence can be added to the component for examples, how the input will be used, or as further clarification to the label.

### Control Qty

The input stepper can have either a single control per row (component) or multiple (side-by-side) input steppers on the same row. Multiple input steppers on the same row provide the ability to input multiple properties for the same parent object. For example, alignment of an object on an X,Y axis with two steppers, one for the X value and another for the Y value.

**Note:** Each of the nested elements and primitives of this form component have properties that can be adjusted to customize the component.
