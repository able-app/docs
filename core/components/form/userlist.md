## Functionality

This form control acts as a container for a collection of people. People are added to the container (horizontal scroll of avatars) by tapping the placeholder (first) avatar to begin the selection process. That process will normally happen in a sheet that appears. Once the selection process is complete the user would close that sheet and those avatars that were selected would appear in the controls horizontal scroll.

**Note:** The structure and spacing of this component is the same between Textfield, Textarea, Selectlist, Chiplist, Slider, Userlist, and Toggle Button.

**Note:** Each of the nested elements and primitives of this form component have properties that can be adjusted to customize the component.
