* Parent: Form (Container)

## Properties

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the radio button control. This label can be positioned either left align or right.

### Style

The styling of the radio button can be altered to present a different appearance. For example, a Service Plan where the user can choose the level they want and we'd want to present an appearance to the control that's a bit more fancy than a simple radio button, with the same underlying functionality of a mutually exclusive choice from a set of options.

**Note:** Each of the nested elements and primitives of this form component have properties that can be adjusted to customize the component.
