* Sister: [PickView](pickview.md)
* Child: [Field](../../../overview/field/), [Label](../../../overview/label.md), [FC - Leading](../fc-leading.md), [FC - Trailing](../fc-trailing.md)

## Properties

**Label** - The component can be presented with a label to give context to the form control. This label can be positioned top (above the field), left, or not at all (none).

**Helper** - Does the component have helper text (On/Off). This is used to provide additional context for the component for examples, how the input will be used, or as further clarification to the label.

**Field Type** - In some situations, like in a sheets search field, we may want to invert the appearance of the field to make it stand out a little better. This property makes that possible.
