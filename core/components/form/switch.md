## Properties

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the switch control. This label can be positioned in the following options...

* Label Left, Control Left
* Label Right, Control Right
* Label Left, Control Right
* Label Right, Control Left

### Style

The styling of the switch can be altered to present a different appearance. For example, we could present an appearance to the control that's a bit more fancy in sign in screen than a pill switch control, with the same underlying functionality.
