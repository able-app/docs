# TextArea

Text areas are taller than text fields and wraps overflow text onto a new line. They are a fixed height and scroll vertically when the cursor reaches the bottom of the field. The large initial size indicates to users that longer copy is possible and provides a general concept for the amount of desired copy based on its field height.
