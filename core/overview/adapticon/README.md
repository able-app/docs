### Size & Shape

### Status

Most of the time an adaptIcon is simply shown as a metaphor for something, but it does have the ability to carry a badge as well. There may be situations where a service like email or alerts would be represented on the screen as an AdaptIcon so it will need the capability of sharing additional information in the form of a badge in those situations.
