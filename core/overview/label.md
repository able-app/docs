# Îµ Label

Element: Words and iconography used widely across the design system to provide context to objects. Almost everywhere you see text or an icon we will use a label.

* Parent: Multiple
* Child: [Icon](icon.md), [Text Style](../../overview/styles/typography.md)

### Properties

**Size** - The general size of the Labels content in respect to other Labels. These sizes are provided by the Theme's Typographical Scale with icon sizes to proportionally match those line heights.

**Type** - The options for arrangement of the type to icon within the Label.

* Text (only)
* Icon (only)
* Icon Left (of text)
* Icon Right (of text)
* Icon Top (of text)
* Icon Bottom (of text)

### Why

We use Labels to maintain consistency within the design system for Type and Icon sizes and the spacing between those objects. A change made to the spacing at this level can dramatically change the look of the entire app.
