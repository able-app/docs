## Usage

A badge is an onscreen object linked to a notification/alert. A badge consists of a small circle, typically containing a number or other characters, that appears in proximity to another element or component. A badge is both a notifier that there are items associated with an object and an indicator of how many items there are.

A badge is used to draw the user's attention to an object, or to emphasize that something may need their attention. For example:

* A "New messages" notification might be followed by a badge containing the number of unread messages.
* A "Shopping cart" badge showing the number of items in the cart.
* A "Status" badge on an Avatar might have an accompanying badge to indicate the users activity status at that moment.

A badge signifies that with a tap of the object tied to the badge, additional information indicated by the badge is accessible. Badges are a common feature in user interfaces, and provide users with a visual clue to help them discover additional relevant content. Their design and use is therefore an important factor in the overall user experience.
