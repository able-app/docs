## Properties

### Type

* **None** (default)- Leaving off the leading content.
* **Icon** - Primarily used to provide a second level of context to the menu option. An example of this would be a list, with it's accessibility options to others (public, private).
* **Avatar** - Used when we want to display a list of users in a menu system.
* **Graphic** - Used when we'd like to display a "Thing" in a menu.
* **AdaptIcon** - For those situtations where we'd show categories of something or a place (ie. map location types).
* **Text** - An option to including leading text content. This could be valuable in situations where we have a Label and Value situation, where this leading text can act as a Label.
