Base: The shape and size of the individual tics that can optionally be shown in or around the slider track. Similar to the tics on a ruler these provide a visual for value increments along the slider track.

**Circle**: The default, circular shape that sits inside the ruler track.

**Box**: A square shape that sits inside the ruler track.

**Line**: A vertical line that sits inside the ruler track.

### Size

To account for the different sizes of ruler tracks we give different sizes of the tics here.

NOTE: This is the first use of ruler and we will use this in other elements and components outside of the slider element.
