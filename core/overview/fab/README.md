## Properties

### Size

To account for multiple usecases the design system has established a set sizing standard for FAB's. The size and shape of the FAB is set in the base level feeder of FAB - Shape and passed to this level.

* Tiny
* XSmall
* Small
* Medium
* Medium Extended

### Badge

Most of the time a FAB displays an icon as a metaphor for the primary action to take on the screens subject matter, but it does have the ability to carry a badge as well. For example, there may be a situation where the FAB acts as a shopping cart where the alert can serve as a cart count.

At the smaller sizes (Tiny, xSmall) of FAB the Badge only acts as a colored badge, meaning there is no numeric value or icon possible within the Badge. At the other sizes the numeric and icon badges are possible.
