# Avatar

Element: Set sizes for display with or without a status badge.

Avatars focus on a subject, using a simple background. They often represent a user or a brand, and are commonly used to represent a user/brand in messaging formats like sms and email. Avatars can be used inside many different elements and components.

## Standards

To account for multiple usecases the design system has established a set sizing standard for certain interface objects, with Avatar being one of those. The size and shape of an Avatar is set within the base level feeder of Avatar - Shape.

## Status

An avatar can have a status badge present to show the user/brands current status \(online, offline, busy, etc.\) or no badge, which may be more appropriate for lists of users.

## State

The state of any nested object \(ie. an element inside of a component\) get's its state from the parent it is nested within.
