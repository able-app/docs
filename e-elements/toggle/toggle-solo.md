# Toggle - Solo

Element: A single on/off toggle button with the appearance of the button. Toggles can be set to act the same as a radio button \(one selection at a time\), or checkboxes \(multiple selections\). Most often seen in a group of toggle buttons \(Toggle - Group\), they can however exist as a single button toggle on/off as well.

## Style

The same styles that are possible in the Button element are available here, with Primary, Secondary, Dark, Neutral, and Lite options for the styling of the toggle button.

## Type

**Text:** The text and text with icon either left or right.

**Icon:** The icon only appearance to a toggle button.

## Status

This property defines if the toggle is set to the "On" or "Off" version.

## Surface

**Line & Fill:** The default appearance, buttons that have a status of "on" show as fills and those that are "off" have a line outlining the button shape.

NOTE: The intent is to NOT have double lines between each toggle-solo when they are grouped together. However, this would complicate the design file more than we'd like, so understand that the right side "lines" of the Left and Center "Locations" should be removed to achieve the desired effect.

**Hidden:** As the title infers, the surface of the button is not shown in this case.

## Location

This is primarily for the multi-toggle option to define the left, center, and right toggles, but we also include the appearance of the toggle when a single toggle button is present.
