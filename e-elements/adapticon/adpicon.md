# Adpicon

Element: Set sizes for display with or without a status badge.

Based off of the concept behind [Adaptive Icons](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive) introduced with Android 8.0, Adpicon's display a simple icon inside a variety of shapes.

## Standards

To account for multiple usecases the design system has established a set sizing standard for certain interface objects, with Adoption being one of those. The size and shape of the Adpicon is set within the base level feeder of Adpicon - Shape.

## Status

Most of the time an adpicon is simply shown as a metaphor for something, but it does have the ability to carry a badge as well. There may be situations where a service like email or alerts would be represented on the screen as an Adpicon so it will need the capability of sharing additional information in the form of a badge in those situations.

## State

The state of any nested object \(ie. an element inside of a component\) get's its state from the parent it is nested within.
