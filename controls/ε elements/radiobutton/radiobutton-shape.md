Parent: [Radio Button](https://github.com/able-app/docs/blob/b10f6d1205bbfb1cddfd150d1390ba848812d9d0/controls/%CE%B5%20elements/radiobutton/radiobutton.md)

To start with we will have two shapes available, the default normal round [radio button](https://zpl.io/V0rdg0E)  (that you see most of the time) and a customized appearance of "[Circle Check](https://zpl.io/anBGkKv)". These "Shapes" are set in the child level area of "Base - Shape" for the parent Radio Button Primitive.

The appearance of the shapes and status (on, off) are supplied from an icon in the icon library (Icons-Base > Icons > Primatives). They are labeled in the icons file as Radio On/Off for the squared off and Selection On/Off for the circular checkbox. Note, this is the same icon file used for the customized Checkbox version as well.
