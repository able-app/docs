# Avatar - Bar

Collection: A grouping for design convenience for display in the bar component.  The bar component can have different background surfaces (colors) so we don't include a surface here. See the [Bar - Structure](https://github.com/able-app/docs/blob/321bb4e8ac5bfd755fec3eeadba56b71e40f06d2/controls/%CE%B5%20elements/graphic/bar-structure.md) documentation to learn more about what goes into a Bar.
