# Icon - Size (Phasing Out)

Base: Standardized sizes for all icons used in the design system. Use this as a property for icons.

**Size** - The general size of the element in proportion to the others in the collection.

- XSmall (12)
- Small (16)
- SMedium (20)
- Medium (24)
- Large (32)
- XLarge (40)
- XXLarge (48)

### Why

By constraining the icon sizes here we maintain a consistency throughout the application.  Additional sizes could be added at this level to increase the options available at parent levels.  Only the sizes listed here should be used in the application.
