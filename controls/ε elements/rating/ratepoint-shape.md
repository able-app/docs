To start with we will have two shapes available, the default star shape  (that you see most of the time) and a customized appearance of  Heart. These "Shapes" are set in the child level area of "Base - Shape" for the parent Rate Point Primitive.

The appearance of the shapes and status (on, off) are supplied from an icon in the icon library (Icons-Base > Icons > Primatives). They are labeled in the icons file as  Star and Star Half for the  default appearance and Heart/Heart Half for the custom option.
