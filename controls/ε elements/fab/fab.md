# Floating Action Button (FAB)

Element: Set sizes for display with or without a status badge.

### Standards

To account for multiple usecases the design system has established a set sizing standard for FAB's.  The size and shape of the FAB is set in the base level feeder of FAB - Shape.

### Status

Most of the time a FAB displays an icon as a metaphor for the primary action to take on the screens subject matter, but it does have the ability to carry a badge as well. For example, there may be a situation where the FAB acts as a shopping cart where the alert can serve as a cart count.
