## Properties

### Shape

**Circle**: The default knob for the slider is a simple circle that can be drug to different locations along the track of the slider to set a value.

**Box**: A square with rounded corners

**Triangle**: A pointing triangle that could be used along with the tics (outside of the track).

**Rectangle, Pill, Pentagon**: Taller knobs to make the sliders grab area stand out a little more. 

### Size

For different slider sizes there's the need for different sizes of knob to proportionally align with the size of the slider track.
