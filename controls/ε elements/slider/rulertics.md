# Ruler - Tics

Base: The shape and size of the individual tics that can optionally be shown in or around the slider track. Similiar to the tics on a ruler these provide a visual for value increments along the slider track.

NOTE: This is the first use of ruler and we will use this in other elements and components outside of the slider element in the future.
