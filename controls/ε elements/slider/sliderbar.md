# Slider Bar

Primitive: A visual bar that allows users to make selection(s) from a range of values with a press/click and drag of a knob.

### Type

Continuous: Provide the ability to set a value(s) along a subjective range.  The best example of this is volume control, where it isn't important to set to a specific value to a single value of volume, but a subjective range.

Discrete: The ability to set a specific value(s) that are snapped to based on allowed values, which can be optionally shown as tics along the track of the slider. With discrete sliders we normally display the selected value(s) as either a label or a floating tooltip above/below the selection knob(s).
