### 

### Standards

To account for multiple usecases the design system has established a set sizing standard for certain interface objects, with AdaptIcon being one of those.  The size and shape of the AdaptIcon is set within the base level feeder of AdaptIcon - Shape.

### Status

Most of the time an adaptIcon is simply shown as a metaphor for something, but it does have the ability to carry a badge as well. There may be situations where a service like email or alerts would be represented on the screen as an AdaptIcon so it will need the capability of sharing additional information in the form of a badge in those situations.
