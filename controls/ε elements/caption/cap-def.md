# Caption - Definitions

### Definitions

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, with multiple caption rows) that are combined to form the cell. Cells do NOT have visual borders around its contents.

**Card:** A container similar to a Cell but with a visually defined edge and padding between the edge and its contents. Cards and cells function the same and just carry different padding and visual appearance.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cell/cards caption into vertically stackable rows. These rows can then be added/subtracted from the caption area depending on the use case.  Inside each caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content containers.
