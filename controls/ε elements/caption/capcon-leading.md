# Caption Container - Leading

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are displayed at the front of the Caption - Title, Description, and Support areas that then make up the vertically stackable, modular pieces of the caption area of Cells and Cards. Please see [Caption - Definitions](https://github.com/able-app/docs/blob/57a78e2f25b43d8f5e72755f1e2740d12a2998ee/controls/%CE%B5%20elements/caption/cap-def.md) for a run down on the structure and terminology used in captions.
