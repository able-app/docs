# Caption Container - Leading

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are displayed at the front of the Caption - Title, Description, and Support areas that then make up the vertically stackable, modular pieces of the caption area of Cells and Cards.

### Definitions

**Leading Style:** The left most column in a caption row to contain things like icons, avatars, adaptions, graphics, labels, or even nothing at all.

**Primary:** The primary content being displayed within a row, this is usually text copy but not always.

**Trailing Style:** The far right column in the caption row used to contain things like actionable or visual icons, buttons, labels or nothing at all.
