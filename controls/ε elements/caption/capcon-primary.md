# Caption Container - Primary

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are the primary content of the Caption - Title, Description, and Support areas that then make up the vertically stackable, modular pieces of the caption area of Cells and Cards.

### Definitions

**Primary:** The primary content being displayed within a row, this is usually text copy but not always.

**Trailing Style:** The far right column in the caption row used to contain things like actionable or visual icons, buttons, labels or nothing at all.
