# Stepper Panel

Component: A panel with spacing and alignment of the Stepper with its collection of step points (primitive) to represent a series of steps involved in a process and your progress. Commonly used in Graphic, when multiple graphics are in a collection, and Hero - Carousel components.

Note: In the Large & XLarge sizes the step point has the option of containing a Label which can be an Icon or Text (number).  This can be used to add more context to the step in the process.

**Alignment** - The location of the Stepper within the panel, either left, right or center (default).

### Interaction

There is no direct interaction with Stepper Panel at this point.  In the future with larger Step Points we may opt for a navigation to that point on press.
