# NavTab Bar

A combo of a left aligned back navigation with a Tab - Bar that will typically use a horizontal-scroll. The navigation on the left side is a toggle button that has a width that hugs its content and the tabs to it's right will disappear behind it when they are side-scrolled.

NOTE: The left side nav could have one or more toggle buttons. In the example it's a solo toggle button, but if additional buttons are added to would form a toggle button group, pushing the Tab - Bar to the right.
