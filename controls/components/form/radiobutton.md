- Parent: Form (Container)
- Child: [RadioButton - Ctrl](https://github.com/able-app/docs/blob/72d886fee42ec503b35d525650866c59084c9480/controls/%CE%B5%20elements/radiobutton/radiobutton.md), [Label](https://github.com/able-app/docs/blob/2956b7cd57098e9f2c27ad3cb3ae8da4842dc0c0/controls/%CE%B5%20elements/label.md)

## Properties

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the radio button control.  This label can be positioned either left align or right.

### Style

The styling of the radio button can be altered to present a different appearance. For example, a Service Plan where the user can choose the level they want and we'd want to present an appearance to the control that's a bit more fancy than a simple radio button, with the same underlying functionality of a mutually exclusive choice from a set of options.



**Note:** Each of the nested elements and primitives of this form component have properties that can be adjusted to customize the component.
