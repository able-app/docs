# ChipList

For use in forms this is a list of options in chip format with different input methods based on the type of chip selected.

Inner element spacing is used for dynamic resizing along with a background surface. 

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the form control.  This label can be positioned above (top), left, or not at all (none). NOTE: Label left for a chiplist is represented as an icon which has a fixed width, we do not use text content that would have variable lengths, as that would alter the chiplists length randomly.

### Helper Text

To provide additional context for the component a sentence can be added to the component for examples, how the input will be used, or as further clarification to the label.

**Note:** The structure and spacing of this component is the same between Textfield, Textarea, Selectlist, Chiplist, Slider, Userlist, and Toggle Button.
