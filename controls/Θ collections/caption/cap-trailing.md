# Cell Caption - Trailing

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are displayed at the end of a bars for the Cell of a Bar or Card.

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, caption rows) that are combined to form the cell.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cells caption into vertical rows These rows can then be added/subtracted from the cells caption depending on the use case.  In a caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content collections.

### Types

### Rows

For situations where we have stacked content in the trailing column, we refer to them as rows. So 2 rows is one object (link, icon, text) stacked on top of another object.  Depending on the use case the spacing between these objects are adjusted at a higher level.
