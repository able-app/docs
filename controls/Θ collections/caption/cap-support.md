# Caption - Support

Collection:  A convenience container for supporting content of a caption row, which is made up of leading, primary, and trailing containers. These are used in Cells and Cards as vertically stackable, modular pieces of the caption area.

### Definitions

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, with multiple caption rows) that are combined to form the cell. Cells do NOT have visual borders around its contents.

**Card:** A container similar to a Cell but with a visually defined edge and padding between the edge and its contents. Cards and cells function the same and just carry different padding and visual appearance.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cell/cards caption into vertically stackable rows. These rows can then be added/subtracted from the caption area depending on the use case.  Inside each caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content containers.

### Subject

This Support area is slightly different from the Title and Description areas of Captions.  Here we are lumping multiple types (listed below) together into one area.

- Link: A word based clickable/tappable navigation point. This may be a persons name for a post, or a brand/store for a product.  There are two confirations to the Link (leading and trailing) of the actual link with helper text either before or after the link.
- Rating: User provided score for the subject matter being presented, this could be a product or post review rating with the total score and the number of reviewers or viewers.
- Stats: To display statistics about the subject matter in a single row with pipes "|" separating each stat.
- Symbols: A series of icons that give the user quick bits of information based on the symbols being shown.  For example, one of the symbols could indicate that a product has an offer on it and another could represent the amount remaining (icon with number).

### Size
