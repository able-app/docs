Double - Two graphics positioned side-by-side in a portrait view on the device.

Triple - Three graphics positioned side-by-side in a portrait view on the device.

### Header

The view either has a header or not within the scrollable view.  Note this is different from a header that is outside of the scrollable area.

### Gutter

The view either carries a gutter on the sides of the content or it doesn't.  Default to doesn't.
