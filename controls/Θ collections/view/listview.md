### Header

The view either has a header or not within the scrollable view.  Note this is different from a header that is outside of the scrollable area.

The background of the view can be lite or dark depending on the use case.  Most often when browsing photos on your device you're displaying these in the dark style, but if your looking at say, Instagram photos in a collection, those would be displayed in a lite style.
