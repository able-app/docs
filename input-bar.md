# Input Bar

Element: A grouping for design convenience for display in the bar component.  The bar component can have different background surfaces (colors) so we don't include a surface here. Input bars are often used in search situations or when short bits of text content is needed for input purposes.

Common input bar layouts are located here and will be added to over time.
