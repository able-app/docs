# Fonts

Used in basically every screen of an application fonts are a basic building block of any app. The fonts you choose can dramatically impact the usability and feel of an app. 

## Families

We refer to groupings of fonts as a "Family" in the case of fonts they usually contain multiple weights and types of the same font family.

### **Base Families**

Here are just a few fonts that we make available by default within the design system. These are all open source fonts that are used frequently. All of these fonts can be found and downloaded on Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

Others that we won't include here can be purchased and uploaded into the system by adding them to the fonts library in the assets section of the design system.
