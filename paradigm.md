###### Commonly accepted methodologies found in the ABLE design system
As a basis for the design system there’s a fundamental paradigm every designer should be familiar with to maintain a system that is clean, clear, concise, and consistent. These universal paradigms, used widely in professions from architecture to graphic design will help guide your decisions while using the ABLE design system.

## Axis
An axis is an imaginary line in space, about which design elements and space are arranged in a balanced and symmetrical manner. Axis gives length and direction, inducing movement and suggesting a path.

#### Alignment

When elements are arranged around an axis, the design feels natural. This brings order to the design because it feels more stable, comfortable and approachable.

#### Reinforcement

An axis is an imaginary line, but you can draw attention to it with the edges of screen elements.  A common example of this concept is task list with iconography.  In the design, a vertical axis helps define a section for iconography on the left and a section for text labels and supporting content on the right.

#### Movement

When we encounter a linear axis, we naturally follow the line, as we do when reading.  Lines prompt eye movement and interaction.  The direction of that movement will depend on the defined start location and end points. A linear axis that promotes interaction and movement is the time scrubber. In the design, you naturally slide the scrubber to the left and right until you reach the desired spot in the video.

#### Continuous

For end points that are undefined, you will follow the axis until you reach something of interest or are tired of interacting with the axis.  This concept is commonly used in lists and more accurately, infinite scroll like you see in apps like Pinterest or Facebooks news feeds. In these designs the vertical axis starts at the top of the list and continues down the screen without a defined stopping point.
