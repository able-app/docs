### Ω Base Layer (Particles)

Base layer kits contain the lowest level objects of the “atomic design” system that make up a theme. These are what designers call "Design Tokens" or in code "Constants". Notice that greek symbols are used throughout the design system. This is our shorthand method of noting which layer an object falls into in the design system. These greek characters are used in our UI Kits to allow for easy organization in alphabetical lists, where the lower layers fall further down in the alphabetical listing. This Base Layer contains styles, dictionaries and libraries:

_Note: As the design system expands we will add new kits to a theme, for example an animations library._
