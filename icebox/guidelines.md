# Guidelines

The ABLE Design System is made up of the styles, components and patterns that are at the foundation of the solution. This foundational language provides for a consistent look and feel for applications and extensions built within the ABLE ecosystem.

## Principles

#### An over-arching guide for the design of experiences

### Clean

| ![](../.gitbook/assets/icn-clean.png) |  A design that’s simple or clean isn’t just about subtracting things, it’s about improving the overall effectiveness. The objective of any designer is to get out of the way of the content by de-emphasizing or stripping away that which isn’t essential. Your goal should always be an experience that feeds people the information they’re looking for, with the least amount of effort on their part. |

### Clear

| ![](../.gitbook/assets/icn-clear.png) |  Good design is clearly understood and doesn’t require explanation. Think about your first experience with a smart phone. It sprung to life, asked you to do a few quick things to set it up, and dropped you into its world. Odds are you didn’t read the manual to know how to use it. |

### Concise

| ![](../.gitbook/assets/icn-concise.png) |  Be brief but comprehensive in your usage of text. Write every word deliberately to get straight to the point. Users comprehend simple words more quickly, even when they’re familiar with a more elaborate alternative. Source: “Technical Communication: A Reader-Centered Approach” by Paul Anderson |

### Consistent

| ![](../.gitbook/assets/icn-consistent.png) |  A consistent app experience uses familiar conventions and patterns. This is accomplished by designing your app using a shared library of interface modules, components, icons, styles, and theming conventions. The resulting experience when moving from one app to another is one that’s familiar in its features and behaviors. An experience users have come to expect from their consumer based smart phones and now line of work devices as well. |
