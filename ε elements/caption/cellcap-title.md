# Cell Caption - Title

Collection:  A convenience container for the caption rows, which is made up of leading, primary, and trailing objects of the Cell caption rows.  Note, we separate those options that are possible in Cells from Cards at this level.  The sister collection to this one is the Card Caption - Title.

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, caption rows) that are combined to form the cell.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cells caption into vertical rows These rows can then be added/subtracted from the cells caption depending on the use case.  In a caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content collections.

### Subject

- Title: The primary content for the cell that can have leading options for an icon, avatar, image, adaptIcon or nothing at all.  The trailing column is often used for additional content or an actionable hotspot with an icon, text, or a button.
- Subtext

### Styles - Leading & Trailing

Here's where we bring in the columns (leading, primary, trailing) in order to customize the layout of the row. Those options available in the lower level caption containers for leading, primary, trailing are available to choose from.
