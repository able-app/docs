# Card Caption - Stats

Collection:  A convenience container for the caption rows, which is made up of leading, primary, and trailing objects of the Cards caption row.  Note, we separate those options that are possible in Cells from Cards at this level.  The sister collection to this one is the Cell Caption - Stats

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, caption rows) that are combined to form the cell.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cells caption into vertical rows These rows can then be added/subtracted from the cells caption depending on the use case.  In a caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content collections.

### Subject

- Rating: A visual representation of a user, entity, product, post, comments rating/score.
- Link: A tappable/clickable navigation to additional content.  This could be a link to more posts by a user, or additional products offered by a brand/store.
- Symbol Bar: A series of icons that give the user quick bits of information based on the symbols being shown.  For example, one of the symbols could indicate that a product has an offer on it.
- Stats: To display statistics about the subject matter in a single row with pipes "|" separating each stat.
- Progress Stepper: This is used in association with Images that would be presented in the card.
- Button Bar: These are the actionable options associated with the card that can be taken.

### Styles - Leading & Trailing

Here's where we bring in the columns (leading, primary, trailing) in order to customize the layout of the row. Those options available in the lower level caption containers for leading, primary, trailing are available to choose from.
