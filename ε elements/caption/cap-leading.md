# Caption - Leading

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are displayed at the front of a bars for the Cell of a Bar or Card.

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, caption rows) that are combined to form the cell.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cells caption into vertical rows These rows can then be added/subtracted from the cells caption depending on the use case.  In a caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content collections.
