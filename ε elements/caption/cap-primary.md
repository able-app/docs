# Caption - Primary

Collection:  A convenience container for those objects that are the primary content of a bars for the Cell of a Bar or Card.

**Cell:**  In bars we have repeating objects that are organized into cells.  This could be a single element like a graphic, or multiple objects (graphic, caption rows) that are combined to form the cell.

**Caption Rows:** We divide the cells caption into vertical rows These rows can then be added/subtracted from the cells caption depending on the use case.  In a caption row we have three columns, the leading, primary, and trailing content collections.

### Types

- None
- Title: Within a caption this is the primary message
- Subtext:  Within a caption this is the secondary or suporting content.  This could be the teaser for a post, or a description for a product.
- Link: A word based clickable/tappable navigation point. This may be a persons name for a post, or a brand/store for a product.  There are two confirations to the Link (leading and trailing) of the actual link with helper text either before or after the link.
- Rating: User provided score for the cells content, this could be a product or post review rating with the total score and the number of reviewers or viewers.
- Stats: To display statistics about the subject matter in a single row with pipes "|" separating each stat.
