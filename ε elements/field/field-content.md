# Field - Content

Element: A grouping for design convenience for display in a field. This base level feeds into the Field element. Not necessary structure for development, but it helps us on the prototyping side to build faster.

### Types

- Text - for short form text content
- Textarea - for long form text content
- Chip - objects added to a collection in the field.

### Ornamentation

**Leading Icon** - Either to signify the type of input a field uses (ex. Calendar, bringing up a calendar modal), or as an alternative to the text label for a more minimal look.

**Trailing Icon** - Used at the end of a field to visually describe input methods as a metaphor (ex. Microphone for audio).
