# App Bar Control - Actions

Primitive: A grouping of actionable buttons, icons, and text that are feed from the App Bar Actions - Solo.  This container provides the horizontal layout of the actions for left and right aligned actionable activities.

### Location

Right - This option provides addition padding to the controls on the right to account for the side of the screen and hit areas.

Left - This option provides adjusted padding to the controls on the left to account for how it aligns with the navigation control.

NOTE: The action control orders are reversed in these two.  The right location actions build from right-to-left (3,2,1) and the left controls build left-to-right (1,2,3).

There's a natural higharchy to the actions that a user will take on a screen and these will be ordered from most used to least used down the action control order.
