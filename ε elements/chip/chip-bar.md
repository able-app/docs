# Chip Bar

Element: A grouping for design convenience for display in the bar component.  The bar component can have different background surfaces (colors) so we don't include a surface here. 

Common chip bar layouts are located here and will be added to over time.

### Behavior

- **Fixed** - The control has a fixed width for display on the screen.
- **Scroll** - The control has an infinite horizontal scroll for its contents.

### Size

- **Base** - The default size, used in the majority of chip situations
- **Field** - When chips are presented inside of a field we use a slightly smaller size that fits within a field component.
