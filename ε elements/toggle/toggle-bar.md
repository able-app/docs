# Toggle Bar

Element: A grouping for design convenience for display in the bar component.  The bar component can have different background surfaces (colors) so we don't include a surface here. 

Common toggle bar layouts are located here and will be added to over time.

### Layout Types

The options available in the "Toggle" element are capable here.

**Solo** - A grouping of solo toggles. An example of this could be different filters on a search, where each toggle is a different filter type (price, weight, rating, etc.) The Yelp app uses this fairly well in their filtering of search results.

**Group** - When the toggle buttons are pushed together and are presented as a grouping of buttons.  By default, this type exists as a singular choice (toggle on) from the group, but can function as a multi-select button as well.  An example of this would be with a text editor grouping with bold, italic, underline where none or all of the groups options can be selected. 

### Style

- Text
- Icon

### Behavior

- **Fixed** - New toggles that don't fit within the fixed width, wrap to the next row, growing the height of the bar - toggle.
- **Scroll** - Toggles that don't fit within the defined width of the parent container scroll off the side of the bar - toggle (screen).
