# Menu Control - Right

Primitive: A convenience container for the content that is possible on the right side of a menu. This allows us to keep those options that are possible on the right side of a memu organized with the ability to easily add new options.

### Options

- **Icon** - Primarily used to provide a second level of context to the menu option.  An example of this would be a list, with it's accessibility options to others (public, private).
- **Choice** - Used to give the user a visual for the menu options that are currently selected.  This choice option can function as a singular choice or multi-choice.
- **Chevron** - When there's the need for hierarchical menu system we can use the chevron to indicate another level of choices in the menu structure.
