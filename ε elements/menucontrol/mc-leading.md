# Menu Control - Leading

Collection: A convenience container for the content that is possible on the left side of a menu. This allows us to keep those options that are possible on the left side of a memu organized with the ability to easily add new options.

### Options

- **Icon** - Primarily used to provide a second level of context to the menu option.  An example of this would be a list, with it's accessibility options to others (public, private).
- **Avatar** - Used when we want to display a list of users in a menu system.
- **Graphic** - Used when we'd like to display a "Thing" in a menu.
- **AdaptIcon** - For those situtations where we'd show categories of something or a place (ie. map location types).
