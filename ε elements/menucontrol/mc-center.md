# Menu Control - Center

Primitive: A container for the primary (center) content of a menu. This allows us to keep those options that are possible as the primary content of a memu organized with the ability to easily add new options.

### Options

- **Title** - The default, single row of text.
- **Title + Subtext** - The primary title text with additional helper text below to provide an additional level of clarity or context to the menu option.
- **Title + 2Subtext** - Two lines below the primary title text for additional context.
- **Title + Rating** - For menu options where we'd like to display a rating structure along with the option. For example, product/service ratings.
