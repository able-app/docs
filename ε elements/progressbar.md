# Progress Bar

Primative: A visual indicator to express either a determined length of time an activity will take, an indeterminate amount of time, or the fact that a query or buffer is happening.  Common uses are the loading of screen contents, video/audio files, the submission of a form, or a software update.



### Types

**Determinate:** Display the length of time a process is expected to take as a visual.  This style of progress bar is used when we know with some certainty, the time it will take to complete the action.

**Indeterminate:** Used when we do not know how long an action will take. It visually shows that activity is happening in the background, but we are still unable to determine the time to completion.



### Usage

- At the center of the screen in a modal or in a blank listview to indicate the loading of screen contents
- As an extension to the App Bar (above or below) that is revealed when a query is preformed and the screens contents are being refreshed.
- In place (replacing) of an action icon to indicate the action is being done.
- At the end of an infinite scroll list when additional content is being fetched.
- Integrated into a button to indicate the action is being preformed
