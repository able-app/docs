# Radio Button

A locked height form component for the selection of one option from a set of multiple options.

Inner element spacing is used for dynamic resizing along with a background surface. 

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the form control.  This label can be positioned either left align or right.

### Style

The styling of the radio button can be altered to present a different appearance. For example, a Service Plan where the user can choose the level they want and we'd want to present an appearance to the control that's a bit more fancy than a simple radio button, with the same underlying functionality of a mutually exclusive choice from a set of options.
