# Checkbox

A locked height form component for the collection of one or more on/off or yes/no input values from a set of options.

Inner element spacing is used for dynamic resizing along with a background surface. 

### Label

The component can be presented with a label to give context to the form control.  This label can be positioned either left align or right.

### Style

The styling of the checkbox can be altered to present a different appearance to the checkbox. For example, a To-Do list being presented with a fancier check than the typical checkbox, but having the same underlying functionality.
